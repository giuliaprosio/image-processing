# image-processing

This repository contains various projects of image processing and analysis, developed following the course "Bases du traitement d'image" of a.a. 2022/2023 at Sorbonne Universit√©

Each folder contains a project with a step-by-step analysis of the methods useful to treat and analyze images.

## 1. Introduction to image enhancement
Go to the [project](./1_Intro_image_enhancement). The first work consists in an introduction to the use of python for pixel manipulation and image enhancement. 

## 2. Fourier analysis 
[Here](./2_Fourier_analysis/) the second project. The second practical work is dedicated to the study of the discrete Fourier transform applied to images and analyze the properties of the 
resulting spectrum.

## 3. 2D sample and aliasing 
[Here](./3_2D_sample_and_aliasing/) the third project. We have studied Fourier transform properties on 1D space. The results can be admitted in a 2-dimensional space too. 

The project studies the limit conditions of sampling of an image to avoid aliasing. 

## 4. Frequency filtering 
[Project 4](./4_Frequency_filtering/). The scope of this project is the study of possible alternatives to have convolutional filtering of images. 

## 5. Edge detection 


## 6. Harris corner detection 

## 7. Split and merge

## 8. Search by content 

## 9-10. Face recognition
